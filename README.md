In the dataset, the groundtruth position of each vehicle is included in the file 'gazebo-model_states'.
For each vehicle, its IMU data is saved under 'vehicle-mavros-imu-data'. Its estimated location is saved under 'vehicle-mavros-global_position-local'.

It is worth mentioning that the orientaions of the vehicles are specified in quaternion.
